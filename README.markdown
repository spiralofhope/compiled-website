Work has halted on the Ruby version of this project.  I'm now
working on a rewrite in Mythryl.


2011-08-20

Everything has been imported from my local archives into git.  I 
have gone through three major rewrites, and the current rewrite is 
both missing some significant functionality and has serious bugs.

Simultaneously, now that everything is live I need to change the way 
a lot of things are done so that a user has a better "out of the 
box" experience.

Have some patience while I hammer the important stuff out.


= How versions work =

Or "what do I download?"

major.minor.revision

'minor' or 'revision' numbers which are EVEN are stable.

'minor' or 'revision' numbers which are ODD are unstable: unfinished,
experimental and generally buggy as hell and I know it.
  - Don't expect these to actually work.  They almost never do!
  - Also, don't expect the most current stuff to actually work.  Until 
    I learn more about branches and other git stuff, I will only be 
    working on the one main branch.  I'll begin tagging things, which 
    should help.

So:

- 1.0.0 is stable.
- 1.0.1 is UNstable.
- 1.1.0 is UNstable.


= My programming style =

My style is extremely verbose.  Extra spaces and gratuitous padding is
added everywhere.  This style is largely inspired by Mythryl:

TODO:  Get into a more lengthy explanation, with examples.
