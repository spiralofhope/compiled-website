How versions work:

major.minor.revision

Even minor/revision numbers are stable.

Odd minor/revision numbers are unstable: unfinished, experimental
and generally buggy as hell and I know it.
- Don't expect these to actually work.  They almost never do!
- Also, don't expect the most current stuff to actually work.  Until I
  learn more about branches and other git stuff, I will only be working
  on the one main branch.  I'll begin tagging things, which should
  help.

So:

- 1.0.0 is stable.
- 1.0.1 is unstable.
- 1.1.0 is unstable.
