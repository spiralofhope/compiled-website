  compiled_website.rb was dated 2011-04-03, but the changelog for this
  entry is dated 2010-04-01.  Previous entries had no changelog to 
  refer to, and were using the date from whatever main .rb file there 
  was.  So those other entries do not have accurate dates, and 
  something screwy was going on.  Meh.
  
  This entry also had a lot of lingering old stuff that I am probably
  re-introducing to git.
  
  * Copied the core stuff over from 0.8.21.
  
  * Renamed a lot of old stuff.
  
  * Changed the directory structure.  Renamed and moved stuff around.
  
  * Merged all of the `live/common/hosted` into `live/common/h`.
  I'm breaking a few links, but I don't care.

  1.0.0_internal
  This represents another complete rewrite.  Previous content was 
  originally kept in old directories, but is now kept in git's history.
  
  I had a changelog marked 2010-04-01 which said:
    
    A complete rewrite.  Presently not functional, but the challenging
    core components have been completed.  Many revisions of my
    experimentation have been left here.
  
  This version only had a slew of markup_experimentation--0.8.21.rb
  files, all with revision numbers.  I'll add them into git.

  0.8.21_internal
  
  * Ported to Ruby 1.9.2.  Still compatible with 1.8.7.
  It was a simple change with my use of the `result` variable and
  arrays.

  0.5.6_internal
  This one introduces CSS, which I will not add to git.  At some future
  point I will create some kind of default theme/templating which can
  then be tracked in the repository.

  0.5.4_internal
  This one seems to work well now, but I had pulled the templating
  (header/footer) functionality to simplify and redo things.
  So that separate code needs to be re-integrated and re-tested.

  * Pre-CHANGELOG
  
  * Began work on a rewrite.

  * This version introduces symbolic links to my libraries.  I'm not
  going to include add the links or the libraries into git, for
  simplicity.  The proper libraries will appear in later revisions,
  when they are no longer merely symbolic links.

  will have to speak for themselves.

  * First ruby implementation.
  
  * Removed txt2tags experimentation.

2008-08-27  spiralofhope  <spiralofhope@lavabit.com>
  
  0.0.1_internal
  This was my first experimentation.
  
  * I went from my own hackish stuff to using txt2tags.
  I still had to play with txt2tags to make it sane.
  
  * I don't even know where my first hackish stuff went.  It's
  probably archived in my projects/programming/ somewhere.
  
  * I'm not sure what I'm doing for this changelog, so I'll refer to:
