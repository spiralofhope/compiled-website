  0.0.1_internal
  This was my first experimentation.
  
  * I went from my own hackish stuff to using txt2tags.
  I still had to play with txt2tags to make it sane.

  * I don't even know where my first hackish stuff went.  It's
  probably archived in my projects/programming/ somewhere.
  
  * I'm not sure what I'm doing for this changelog, so I'll refer to:
