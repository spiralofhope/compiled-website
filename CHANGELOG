  0.0.6_internal
  Did I really take this long of a break?  Ouch.
  
  * This was before I maintained this CHANGELOG, so the code changes
  will have to speak for themselves.

  0.0.4_internal
  
  * First ruby implementation.
  
  * Removed txt2tags experimentation.

2008-08-27  spiralofhope  <spiralofhope@lavabit.com>
  
  0.0.1_internal
  This was my first experimentation.
  
  * I went from my own hackish stuff to using txt2tags.
  I still had to play with txt2tags to make it sane.
  
  * I don't even know where my first hackish stuff went.  It's
  probably archived in my projects/programming/ somewhere.
  
  * I'm not sure what I'm doing for this changelog, so I'll refer to:
